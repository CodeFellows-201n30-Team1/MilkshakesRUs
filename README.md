# MilkshakesRUs

## Milk Smoothie

We will have the user choose the flavors they like, based on their answers we will suggest a smoothie for them. We will show the picture and the price at the end.

This project will help us to learn in depth CSS and JS. If there is a worker shortage and customers need to order from a machine by themselves, but don’t know which one to try, our website will help them choose!

## Project Description and Problem Domain

## Support Software

[Asana](https://asana.com/) was used as our project management software to track tasks and keep everyone on the same page.<br>
[ChatGPT](https://chatgptonline.io/) was used to calculate the calories of the ingredients that we then used as input for our total calorie count calculations.<br>

## Gratitude

*A special thanks to all the TAs for their help and especially Stephanie Hill for her guidance and being SUPER PATIENT with all of our questions!*<br>
