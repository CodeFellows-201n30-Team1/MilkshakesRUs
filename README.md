# MilkshakesRUs

Milk Smoothie:
We will have the user choose the flavors they like, based on their answers we will suggest a smoothie for them. We will show the picture and the price at the end.

This project will help us to learn in depth CSS and JS. If there is a worker shortage and customers need to order from a machine by themselves, but donâ€™t know which one to try, our website will help them choose!

MVP:
>+ Working website
>+ Interactive image
>+ Price total calculated
>+ Minimum 4 options for users to choose.
>+ Including questions : none for an answer

Potential Additional Features:
>+ Calories calculated
>+ Picture tiles of toppings
>+ Implement Chat GPT
