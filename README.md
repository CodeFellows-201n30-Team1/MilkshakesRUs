# MilkshakesRUs

## Milk Smoothie

We will have the user choose the flavors they like, based on their answers we will suggest a smoothie for them. We will show the picture and the price at the end.

This project will help us to learn in depth CSS and JS. If there is a worker shortage and customers need to order from a machine by themselves, but don’t know which one to try, our website will help them choose!
