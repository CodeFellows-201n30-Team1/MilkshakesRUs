# Minimum Viable Product vs
*What will your MVP functionality be?*
Have users able to three questions to design and purchase a milkshake of their choice and know how much it costs.

A user can update their profile information.

# Functional Requirements
A user clicks on images or alternative texts of the ingredients they want and those ingredients are compiled into a milkshake.  The cost and total calories are calculated.

# Data Flow
User will open the website and click a button to start the process.  The user will see questions about ingredients with pictures and ingredient names as choices.  The user will then choose 4 ingredients (with the option to add no ingredients for that question).  The app then renders a compilation of all the input with a fancy picture of a milkshake, the calorie total and the total cost.  The user then has the option to save the order for the next time they visit and then the data is in local storage.
